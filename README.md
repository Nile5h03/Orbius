## 🔍 About  

**Orbius** isn’t just a name — it’s inspired by one of Jupiter’s distant moons.  
Just like that quiet celestial body orbiting a giant planet, **Orbius provides a calm, safe space where emotions can orbit without judgment.**  

Expressing emotions can be difficult, especially for young men who fear judgment, stigma, or misunderstanding.  
**Orbius is a web-based role-playing conversational platform** designed to create a safe, emotionally supportive environment.  

Through role-play modes like **Best Friend, Girlfriend, or Ex-Girlfriend**, Orbius enables users to express, reflect, and heal — in ways that are often difficult in real life.
